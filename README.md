## Overview
- **Dynamol**: Efficient mathematical computation module, providing arbitrary-sized numerical types
- **Drypto**: Cryptographically-secure, constant-time mathematical operations and entropy-generation module
- **dBedded**: Light-weight, maximmally-flexible embedded development module
- **dIOstream**: Generic, powerful I/O handling of lib-dnml types above


## Key Features
- **Arbitrary-Precision**: Integers (bigInt) & Floating-point numbers (bigFloat) 
- **Cryptographically secure**: Constant-time operations against timed-based attacks
- **Cross-platform Compability**: Supported on nearly all 64 bit platform, (see more in [Platform Compatibily](#platform-compatibiltiy))
- **Integration Friendly**: Seamlessly integrate with other projects while maintaining performance and control


## Architecture Goals
- **Predictable** memory behavior
- Explicit control over **performance-critical** operations
- **Explicit memory-usage** for temporary objects (Crypto and Embedded)


## Platform Compatibiltiy
- **Supported Architectures**:
  - *x86_64* 
  - *AARCH64*
  - *RV64*
- **Supported Platform/OS**:
  - *Windows* (MinGW, MSVC - x64, ARM64)
  - *MacOS* (x64, ARM64)
  - *Linux* (GNU, non-GNU - x64, ARM64, RV64)
  - *Android* and *iOS* (ARM64)
  - *BSD-based* (OpenBSD, FreeBSD - x64, ARM64, RV64)


## Example Usage
~~~c
#include "dynamol.h"
// OR #include <dynamol.h>

int main(void) {
    bigInt a, b, res;

    bigInt_init(&res);
    bigInt_init(&a, "1234989689842");
    bigInt_init(&b, "1923895849860");

    bigInt_add(&a, &b, &res);
    bigInt_print(&res);
    return 0;
}
